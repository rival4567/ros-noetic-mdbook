# Gazebo Simulator

Gazebo is a 3D dynamic simulator with the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments. While similar to game engines, Gazebo offers physics simulation at a much higher degree of fidelity, a suite of sensors, and interfaces for both users and programs.

## Features

-   multiple physics engines,

-   a rich library of robot models and environments,

-   a wide variety of sensors,

-   convenient programmatic and graphical interfaces
