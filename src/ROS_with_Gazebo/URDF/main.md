## What is a URDF Model?
  
  The URDF (Universal Robot Description Format) model is a collection of files that describe a robotâ€™s physical description to ROS. These files are used by ROS to tell the computer what the robot actually looks like in real life. URDF files are needed in order for ROS to understand and be able to simulate situations with the robot before a researcher or engineer actually acquires the robot. You can learn more about URDF files and packages on [wiki.ROS.org](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf).
