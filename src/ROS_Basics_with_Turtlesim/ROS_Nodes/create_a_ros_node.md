# Create a ROS Node
In this section we will learn how to create a ROS Node inside `pkg_ros_basics` ROS Package which we created in the previous section.
  1. Navigate to `pkg_ros_basics`.
     ```bash
     cd ~/catkin_ws/src/pkg_ros_basics
     ```
     OR
     ```bash
     roscd pkg_ros_basics
     ```
     **NOTE**: `roscd` will work only if you have sourced `setup.bash` of your catkin workspace.
  2. Create a `scripts` folder for your Python scripts and navigate into the folder.
     ```bash
     mkdir scripts
	 cd scripts
     ```
  3. Create a Python script called `node_hello_ros.py`.

     ```bash
     touch node_hello_ros.py
     ```


  4. Open the script in any text-editor and start editing.
     ```bash
     gedit node_hello_ros.py
     ```

  5. First line of all your Python ROS scripts should be the following shebang
	 ```bash
	 #!/usr/bin/env python
	 ```

  6. Now write a ROS Node to print `Hello World!` on the console.
     ```python
     #!/usr/bin/env python

	 import rospy


	 def main():    
    
     # 1. Make the script a ROS Node.
     rospy.init_node('node_hello_ros', anonymous=True)

     # 2. Print info on console.
     rospy.loginfo("Hello World!")
     
     # 3. Keep the node alive till it is killed by the user.
     rospy.spin()


     if __name__ == '__main__':
         try:
             main()
         except rospy.ROSInterruptException:
             pass
     ```


  7. Now you have to make this script an executable.
     ```bash
     sudo chmod +x node_hello_ros.py
     ```


  8. Now in order to run your ROS Node,

       1. Open up a terminal and run ROS Master.

	      ```bash
	      roscore
	      ```

       2. Once the roscore is up running, open a new termminal and run the ROS Node.
          ```bash
          rosrun pkg_ros_basics node_hello_ros.py

          ```
          
          **NOTE**: This command will work only if you have sourced `setup.bash` of your catkin workspace either manually or using `.bashrc`.


  9. You should get some output like this,
  	 ```bash
     [INFO] [1601277063.968749]: Hello World!
     ```
