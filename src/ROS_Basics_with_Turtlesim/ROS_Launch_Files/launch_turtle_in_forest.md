# Example #2: Launch Turtle in Forest

## Aim

- To write a launch file to run `turtlesim_node` node and `turtle_teleop_key` node present in `turtlesim` package.

- While launching the `turtlesim_node` make sure to change the background colour of the simulator from blue to forest green.
- Name the launch file `turtlesim.launch` and save it in `launch` folder inside `pkg_ros_basics` package.

## Code

`turtlesim.launch`
```xml
<launch>
    
    <node pkg="turtlesim" type="turtlesim_node" name="node_turtlesim_node">
        <param name="/background_r" value="34" />
        <param name="/background_g" value="139" />
        <param name="/background_b" value="34" />
    </node>
    
    <node pkg="turtlesim" type="turtle_teleop_key" name="node_turtle_teleop_key" />

</launch>
```
